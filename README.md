# Coding_Challenge
Amount of time:
    The amount of time I took to code this challenge was 3 hours 22 minutes. After completing the challenge (to the best of my knowlege), I tried to add a few bells and wistles to make it look a bit better and run like I would expect a program to run.

While I was coding (near the end), I thoght of a few ways I could make this run a bit better using less lines of code. Instead of referencing each letter individually I should have put each letter into a dictionary to reference each value that way resulting in fewer lines of code.
